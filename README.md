Project Description:
- The WeatherBot Chat Application is a conversational interface designed to provide weather information based on user queries. It utilises ChatterBot for natural language processing and leverages the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data.

How to Install and Run the Project:
- Installation: Please use the Zip file to open as I couldn't upload all libraries onto GitHub. 
You'll be able to run the chatbot from "chatbot.py"

How to Use the Project:
- Enter queries related to weather (e.g., "What's the weather in Sydney?") and receive weather information.
Interacting with the API:
- The application interacts with the OpenWeather API to fetch weather data based on user queries.

Credits/Acknowledgement:
- ChatterBot Library: Used for natural language processing in the chat interface.
